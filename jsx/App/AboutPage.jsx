      <p>This site is a pilot adaptation of LingView by students at McGill University in collaboration with Kanienke'há:ka, for educational purposes. We thank you for your interest. </p>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to support Kanien'kéha language learners. The stories available on this website are shared with the consent of the speakers. </p>
      <p>This site is a final project for LING 415/610 at McGill University in Fall 2023. Jinny Choi, Alex Ito, Blair Jackson, Austin Kraft, and Xindi Zhang contributed. Mary Onwá:ri Tekahawáhkwen McDonald generously contributed Kanien'kéha expertise in the course of this project and throughout LING 415/610. Any errors or misrepresentations are the students' responsibility.</p>
    <h2>About Kanien'kéha</h2>
        <p>Kanien'kéha, also known by the exonym Mohawk, is a Northern Iroquoian language spoken in modern-day Ontario, Quebec, and New York State. As of 2021, there are approximately 560 L1 speakers and 80 advanced L2 speakers (DeCaire 2023), with many more intermediate speakers.
        Kanien'kéha grammar is known for its large inventory of pronominal prefixes and kinship terms, its highly agglutinative morphology, and its frequent usage of noun incorporation. 
            This website is intended as a prototype for language resources, to be customized according to community interests and needs.
        </p>
        <p>The Kanien'kehá:ka—the speakers of Kanien'kéha—are leading language revitalization programs including adult immersion, to reestablish generational transmission of the language.</p>
    <h2>About the orthography</h2>
        <p>In the transcriptions on this site, we generally adhere to the orthography standards established for Kanien'kéha (Lazore 1993), acknowledging that there is dialectal variation in how particular sounds are represented. </p>
